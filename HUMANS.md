# ModelAtlas Memo: The TruthForge Paradigm Shift

This memo summarizes the late-night directive from the lead architect. It lays out the philosophy and strategic redesign of ModelAtlas as a "truth forge" and cognitive system.

## I. Cognitive Architecture: Beyond the Trace
- Replace the linear `Ollama → RECURSOR-1 → TrustForge` trace with a directed acyclic graph of cognitive functions.
- Introduce a central `AtlasState` model representing short-term memory. Functions take and return this state.
- Refactor modules into cognitive functions such as `propose_enrichment`, `challenge_hypothesis`, and `identify_gaps`.
- Rework `enrich/main.py` into an orchestrator that selects which function to execute next based on the current state.

## II. Traceability as Soul
- Treat trace logs as an immutable ledger of thought.
- Use semantic hashing for content-addressable storage and de-duplication.
- Chain hashes to show how each conclusion was reached.

## III. DX as Symbiosis
- The developer is a cognitive partner, not just a user.
- Provide interactive time-travel debugging via `atlas debug --trace-id <hash>`.
- Documentation should read like a manifesto, inspiring contributors.

## Final Mandates
1. The cognitive cycle is mandatory.
2. All data must be content-addressed.
3. The CLI becomes the primary interface for neuro-symbolic interaction.

This direction transforms ModelAtlas from an assembly line into a system that models thinking itself. The forge begins here.
