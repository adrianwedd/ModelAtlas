  "license": "For this release, Meta has evaluation the performance on over 150 benchmark datasets that span a wide range of languages. In addition, Meta performed extensive human evaluations that compare Llama 3.1 with competing models in real-world scenarios. Meta\u2019s experimental evaluation suggests that our flagship model is competitive with leading foundation models across a range of tasks, including GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Additionally, Meta\u2019s smaller models are competitive with closed and open models that have a similar number of parameters.",
