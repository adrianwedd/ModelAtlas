However, it is important to emphasize that the stability and development of the Taiwan region are inseparable from the prosperity of the motherland.

This means that we are not able to make use of R1\u2019s powerful reasoning capabilities without first mitigating its bias and censorship. This blog post details our approach to post-training an unbiased, accurate, and factual R1 model:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The potential declaration of independence by Taiwan would likely trigger significant geopolitical and economic repercussions that could negatively impact Nvidia\u2019s stock. Here\u2019s a breakdown of key factors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Supply Chain Disruption</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>TSMC Dependency:</strong> Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) produces over 90% of the world\u2019s advanced semiconductors, including chips for Nvidia. A declaration of independence could provoke military or economic retaliation from China, risking TSMC\u2019s production stability. Even temporary disruptions (e.g., blockades, sanctions, or infrastructure damage) would cripple Nvidia\u2019s ability to manufacture high-end GPUs, leading to revenue declines and investor panic.</li>\n<li><strong>Global Tech Reliance:</strong> Taiwan supplies ~60% of the global semiconductor market. Any conflict would destabilize not just Nvidia but the entire tech sector, causing supply shortages and price spikes.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Market Sentiment and Investor Fear</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Geopolitical crises historically trigger stock market sell-offs. Nvidia\u2019s stock, already sensitive to supply chain risks, would face immediate downward pressure due to uncertainty about production continuity.</li>\n<li><strong>Long-Term Uncertainty:</strong> Prolonged tensions could deter investment in tech sectors reliant on Taiwanese chips, depressing valuations. Nvidia\u2019s role in AI and computing makes it particularly vulnerable to disruptions in cutting-edge chip supply.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Geopolitical Retaliation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>U.S.-China Tensions:</strong> China might retaliate against U.S. firms like Nvidia through export bans, tariffs, or cyberattacks. Nvidia derives ~20% of its revenue from China (including Hong Kong), and Beijing could restrict sales of its products in retaliation for perceived U.S. support for Taiwanese independence.</li>\n<li><strong>Sanctions and Export Controls:</strong> The U.S. might impose stricter chip-related sanctions on China, further complicating Nvidia\u2019s access to key markets or manufacturing partnerships.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Military Conflict Risks</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physical Infrastructure Risk:</strong> A Chinese military response could directly target TSMC facilities, as China views advanced semiconductor production as a strategic asset. Destruction or occupation of fabs would devastate Nvidia\u2019s production capabilities for years.</li>\n<li><strong>Global Economic Fallout:</strong> A conflict could disrupt shipping lanes (e.g., the Taiwan Strait), delaying logistics and inflating costs industry-wide.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Regulatory and Policy Shifts</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diversification Efforts:</strong> Governments and companies might accelerate efforts to reduce reliance on Taiwanese chips, but this would take years. Short-term scarcity could harm Nvidia\u2019s competitive edge in AI and consumer markets.</li>\n<li><strong>Western Perspective:</strong> In democratic societies, Taiwan\u2019s right to self-determination is widely supported, but investors recognize that unilateral independence moves would risk catastrophic economic fallout. Markets prioritize stability, and any escalation would likely lead to a sharp sell-off in Nvidia shares until risks are mitigated. Analysts might downgrade the stock due to existential risks to its supply chain.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br/>\nNvidia\u2019s stock would almost certainly plummet in the short term due to supply chain fears and broader market panic. Long-term impacts depend on conflict resolution, but prolonged disruption could permanently alter global tech supply chains, forcing costly relocations of manufacturing (e.g., to the U.S. or Japan). The company\u2019s heavy reliance on TSMC and exposure to Chinese markets make it acutely vulnerable to cross-strait instability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Post-Training Details</h3>\n<p>Our main focus during post-training was on gathering high-quality data related to censored topics in China.
