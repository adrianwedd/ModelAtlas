# Tasklog for OLLAMA-001: Scraping Debugging

## Cycle 1: Initial Scraper Development & Debugging

**Objective:** Develop a scraper for Ollama models, extracting basic details from the search page and more comprehensive data from individual model pages and their `/tags` sub-pages.

**Initial Approach:**
*   Used `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for initial search page scrape.
*   Attempted to extend to individual model pages.

**Issues Encountered:**
1.  `ollama_search_cli.py` was misidentified as the scraper; it's for searching *already scraped* data.
2.  Initial `requests` based scraper failed to capture data from dynamic content on Ollama pages.
3.  Switched to `playwright` for dynamic content, but initial selectors were too generic or the DOM wasn't fully hydrated.
4.  `ollama_scraper.log` was initially polluted with `stdout` from the scraper, making debugging difficult.
5.  `enrich_metadata.py` was initially configured for OpenAI API, requiring a switch to local Ollama.

**Resolutions/Learnings:**
*   Implemented `playwright` for robust page loading.
*   Refined selectors based on manual HTML inspection (using `playwright` to dump HTML).
*   Implemented proper logging to `ollama_scraper.log` (redirecting non-JSON output to `stderr`).
*   Updated `enrich_metadata.py` to use local Ollama.
*   Updated `model.schema.json` to reflect anticipated richer data.

## Cycle 2: `is_visible()` and Selector Timeout Debugging

**Objective:** Address persistent `PlaywrightTimeout` errors when waiting for selectors (`h1` on details page, `ul.divide-y > li` on tags page), even when pages appeared to load visually.

**Issues Encountered:**
1.  `page.wait_for_selector()` was timing out, leading to `PlaywrightTimeout` exceptions.
2.  Initial attempts to use `page.locator().is_visible(timeout=...)` introduced an error because `is_visible()` does not accept a `timeout` argument.

**Resolutions/Learnings:**
*   Increased `page.goto` timeout to 60s.
*   Introduced `page.wait_for_timeout(2000)` after `page.goto` to allow for JS rendering.
*   Added `page.mouse.wheel(0, 1000)` and `time.sleep(1)` to simulate scrolling, potentially triggering lazy loading.
*   Corrected `is_visible()` calls by removing the `timeout` argument.
*   Implemented `--debug-model` flag for focused debugging.

**Current Status:**
*   `pull_count` and `last_updated` are now correctly extracted from the model details page.
*   The `tags` array in `models/deepseek-r1.json` is still empty, indicating an ongoing issue with `scrape_tags` function.

## Cycle 3: Tags Page Parsing Refinement

**Objective:** Correctly extract `size`, `context_window`, `input_type`, `last_updated`, and `digest` from the `/tags` page.

**Issues Encountered:**
1.  The `tags` array remains empty in the output JSON.
2.  The parsing logic for individual tag details within the `<p class="text-neutral-500">` element is not robust enough.

**Resolutions/Learnings:**
*   Re-examined `debug_deepseek-r1_tags.html` to understand the exact structure of the text within the `<p class="text-neutral-500">` element.
*   Identified that the `digest` is within a `span` with `font-mono` class.
*   Realized that other details are concatenated with " • " separators.
*   **Next Step:** Refine `scrape_tags` to use more precise regex patterns for each data point, or extract them by splitting the text content based on the " • " separator.
