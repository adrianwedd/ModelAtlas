# Task 22: Introduce test suite

## Summary
Documented the packages required for running the unit tests and provided a helper `Makefile` target to install them. Updated the task status to in-progress.

## Notes
- Added `pytest` to `requirements.txt` for easier installation.
- CONTRIBUTING now instructs contributors to run `playwright install`.
