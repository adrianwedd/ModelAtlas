# Task 17: Expand .gitignore

## Summary
Replaced the minimal `.gitignore` with a comprehensive Python template and ensured UTF-8 encoding in helper scripts.

## Notes
- `.gitignore` now excludes compiled objects, build artifacts, IDE folders, virtual environments, and common logs.
- Updated helper scripts to open files with `encoding='utf-8'` for cross-platform consistency.
