# Task 417: Write CLI search tests

## Summary
Implemented a lightweight search module and accompanying tests. Added a Typer command to expose the search feature via the CLI and ensured coverage exceeds 80%.

## Notes
- search.load_models prints a helpful message when the catalog is missing.
- pytest now includes tests for load_models, search_models and the CLI entry point.
